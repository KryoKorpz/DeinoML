DeionML, named after the dinosaur Deinonychus, or what most people would think of when they hear "velociraptor"
Being among the smartest of dinosaurs, I felt it a fitting name!

The purpose of this project is a full stack application with a simple interface for uploading machine learning data.
This project will consist of a nextjs webapp, etcd cache, okta authentication, and and apache cassandra database.

- apache cassandra has caching by default, but for the sake of learning I will attempt to integrate the etcd cache over the top of the cassandra database.
